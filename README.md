# Toto Photo

An [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api) project to practice using a third party API. In the case of this project: Flickr's API.

This super simple app has a single form field to take a Flickr user's ID and display that user's photos.

This project is a nice starter reference for using the following gems:

* RestClient, used for calling the api.

* Nokogiri, used for parsing/searching the xml returned by the api.

* Figaro, used for setting/storing environmnet variables for my api key, etc.
